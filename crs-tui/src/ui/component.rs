//! Every piece of UI derives from the same [`Component`] trait for better
//! organisation. This module defines the specifications of this trait.

/// An infinite loop is executed to re-redner the app. The UI is rendered, then
/// blocked until an [`Event`] occurs. After when this event occurs, the
/// component is updated then the screen is redrawn.
///
/// The struct deriving the component should contain the data needed for the
/// [`Self::draw`] method, and nothing else.
///
/// If events happen that depend on this component, the [`Self::on_event`] is
/// called. It returns an [`Self::UpdateState`] that is used to send information
/// to the parent component if need be.
